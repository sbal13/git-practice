# Git!



## What is it?

Git is a version control system (VCS) used for saving code and managing contributions to it. It allows you to keep all previous versions of your code without having to keep around seperate copies of your code.

## How does it work?

Git uses a data structure called a linked list to connect nodes called "commits" to each other.

A commit is composed of 3 main pieces of information:
1. The name of the commit (usually a hashed value)
2. The content of the commit (the changes made during that commit)
3. A pointer to the next commit
