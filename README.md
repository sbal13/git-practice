# Git!

## What is it?

Git is a version control system (VCS) used for saving code and managing contributions to it. It allows you to keep all previous versions of your code without having to keep around seperate copies of your code.

## How does it work?

## Saving 

`git add`

`git commit`

## Reading

`git log`

`git diff`

## Remote vs local

`git push`

`git fetch`

`git pull`
